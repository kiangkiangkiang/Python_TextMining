# Term Frequency Proportional Document Frequency (TFPDF) - implemented by python

Term Frequency and Proportional Document Frequency (TF*PDF) is employed as a means to detect hot topics from patents, 
and IPCs are used to calculate semantic importance of terms based on the IPCs where terms are distributed. 
Aging Theory is also used to calculate the variation of trends over time.

# Python code

1. Unzip text files into the same location to the tfpdf python file.

2. Because of the Chinese demonstration, a CKIP segmentation of Chinese words will be used. User have to go to http://ckipsvr.iis.sinica.edu.tw/
and register to enable the CKIP module.

3. In tfpdf python file, change to your CKIP accounts, and start up the demonstration of exist files.
